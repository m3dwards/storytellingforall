# Cath Edwards
### Storytelling for all

> Cath has a warm and witty style of storytelling and she has a wonderful sense of humour.

My repertoire is largely based on traditional and folk tales. I revel in sourcing stories, making them my own and passing them on so that my audiences can love them as much as I do.

I learnt a love of folklore and stories as a small child; as an adult I told stories to my own children, and then, as a teacher, worked with children through story. I now tell stories to adult audiences, family audiences, small children, school-age children and children and young people with special needs.
