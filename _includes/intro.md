# Cath Edwards

### Storytelling for all

> Cath has a warm and witty style of storytelling and she has a wonderful sense of humour.

My repertoire is largely based on traditional and folk tales. I revel in sourcing stories, making them my own and passing them on so that my audiences can love them as much as I do

I learnt a love of folklore and stories as a small child; as an adult I told stories to my own children, and, as a teacher, worked with children through story. I now tell stories to adult audiences, family audiences, very young children, school-age children and children and young people with special needs.

I am co-host of Lichfield Storytellers and the Society for Storytelling Midlands Representative. My book [West Midlands Folk Tales](https://www.thehistorypress.co.uk/publication/west-midlands-folk-tales/9780750985390/) is available from The History Press; Warwickshire Folk Tales is in preparation.
