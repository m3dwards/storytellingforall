# Cath Edwards

### Storytelling for all

> Cath has a warm and witty style of storytelling and she has a wonderful sense of humour.

My repertoire is largely based on traditional and folk tales. I revel in sourcing stories, making them my own and passing them on so that my audiences can love them as much as I do

I learnt a love of folklore and stories as a small child; as an adult I told stories to my own children, and, as a teacher, worked with children through story. I now tell stories to adult audiences, family audiences, very young children, school-age children and children and young people with special needs.

I am co-host of Lichfield Storytelling Club and Society for Storytelling Midlands Representative. My West Midlands Folk Tales is available from The History Press; Warwickshire Folk Tales is in preparation.
